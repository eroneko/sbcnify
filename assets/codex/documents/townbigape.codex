    "by Greenfinger of the Floran
I will admit, the ape is not to my tastes. He is brash, boorish and a poor tactician. His insistence in appearing behind a video screen is tiresome - he forgets I know all his little secrets.",

    "And yet, he's an invaluable ally. I may not agree with his methods, but his goals are sound. And he has the ear of the self-styled lord, Thornwing. Strange times make for strange bedfellows. It's not like anything is conventional these days."
