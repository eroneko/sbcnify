    "A young Floran once set out upon her coming-of-age journey, armed only with a spear, six knives, some shurikens, a whip, a saw, a staff, a sword and a piece of bone that was really sharp. Woefully under-equipped, she made her way into the Forest of Stabbing, prepared to take on her first challenge.",

    "There she encountered the legendary Giant Flesh Monkey That Smells, and began her hunt. The hunt was over quickly, as the Giant Flesh Monkey was peacefully asleep when the Floran plunged her spear into its eye. With her first trial over, the Floran tentatively made her way onto the next ordeal."
