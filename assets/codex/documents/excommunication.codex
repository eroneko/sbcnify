    "by Greenfinger of the Floran
One day I was fortunate enough to meet with a member of the Avian Clipped Council, a group of flightless Avians who serve their ruler, Kluex. We shared talk, and stories, and eventually a bottle of particularly potent meatwine. This loosened the Avian's tongue even more, and I was able to ask her about the Grounded, and how her people deal with those who defy their god.",

    "Many are simply sent from the villages, she told me, occasionally even hounded off-planet if their heresy is grand enough. Others, however, are subjected to a process which even to myself sounds barbaric. She stressed, repeatedly, that this behaviour was no longer endorsed by the Clipped Council.",

    "Atheist Avians who require punishment are dipped in a vat of tar-like liquid, which solidifies over their feathers, turning their plumage into what is essentiallystone. Seeing as the Avians cannot fly, it's a largely symbolic gesture, but one which serves to shame the subject.",

    "Naturally, I asked my acquaintance for a sample of this tar, which she promised to ship to me. Barbarism aside, the potential of combining it with Floran biology may lead to advancements in ground troop armour."
