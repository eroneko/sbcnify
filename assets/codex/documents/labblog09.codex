    "I'm writing this from beneath a desk. I'm hiding. If I don't make it out of here, spread my story. Make sure the universe knows what happened. I can hear gunfire, and screams, and a terrible, pained roaring sound.",

    "Big Ape arrived. Just knocked on the door and announced he was here. Of course, I threw it open excitedly. Doctor Lax, stepping out of her chamber, screamed for me to stop, but it was too late. A figure stood there, wearing an ill-fitting ape costume.",

    "Tearing off the costume, the creature tossed me aside. I've never seen a beast like it. It was sentient; it spoke to Doctor Lax, told her that her time was up, that the Ring of Thorns had found her. It began to chase her through the compound, as I cowered beneath my desk."
