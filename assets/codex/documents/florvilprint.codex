    "After many years of hard toil, under the watchful gaze of my patient mentor Professor Irondome, I am ready. I have a vocabulary to rival even the brightest Hylotl, the imagination to outdo the most energetic human, and the spiritual understanding to out-theologise an Avian.",

    "My work begins today. My novel, my story. A masterwork of literature, a true piece of art in the spirit of my people, the inimitable Florans. I sit here, now, in this recreational area, a cup of brewed sap beside me, this strange computer on my table. I tap away at the keys, and feel the power of literature beneath my stems.",

    "Our story will be told."
