    "Unusually, Greenfinger had stipulations in regards to my experiments. I could do what I wished, as long as he was in attendance. He arrived at my lab moments after receiving my agreement, almost as if he'd been here the whole time.",

    "Being in the presence of Greenfinger is, as usual, disconcerting. Every time I turn around and see him, I am forced to ensure I don't recoil in alarm. Not that Greenfinger is the sensitive sort.",

    "He is a brilliant, brilliant scientist however. I feel like a child fumbling in the dark in comparison. Within half a day, he had perfected a theoretical gene-splice between the Florans and the Apex, and constructed a plan for slow-burning experimentation."
