    "Delight. My young charge has thrown himself into the task of producing a novel with aplomb. Contentment. He sits up there, day in, day out, typing away on the computer I procured for him. Hesitant. He refuses to allow me to read what he has written, however.",

    "Understanding. But he is an artist! Realisation. I must let him work, let the words flow, let the genius come forth. Excitement. I know what dwells within his heart, and what stories he has to tell. Overwhelmed. My protégé's work will impact throughout the universe."
