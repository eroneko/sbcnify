    "Today, my job begins. A job that many Avians do not know exists. I am the keeper of a tomb - a very special tomb - and it almost feels sacrilegious to write down why. But this journal is for my eyes only; within this tomb resides Harspex, one of the Sunborn.",

    "I have seen her tomb, once, when I was given the tour by a member of the Council. It is hidden deep within the bowels of this place, down hidden passageways and behind secret doors. I am not sure I will ever find it again, as is the intention."
