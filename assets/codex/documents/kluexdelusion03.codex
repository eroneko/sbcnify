    "by Rochard Hawkwings
I have discovered some startling similarities between Kluex and Big Ape, the ruler of the Apex. They are both mysterious figures, and they both rule. Having researched Avian history, I came to the conclusion that it's entirely possible the Clipped Council met with Big Ape in the past.",

    "Perhaps this is where the idea for Kluex came from. Perhaps Kluex's space station is simply filled with Miniknog technology, reading our every thought. I will reach out to Big Ape himself, for comment."
