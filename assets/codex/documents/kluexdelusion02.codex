Prayer. Something the Clipped Council extol the virtues of. But how, I ask, can Kluex hear our prayers? Even according to the mythology, he is a simple Avian who ascended to Godhood through the power of flight. Flight! Not super-hearing.",

    "But you know what DOES have super-hearing? A SPY SATELLITE. That's right. Every time you pray, that spy satellite records your words, documents them, and saves them for use against you. Maybe the Council has been taking tips from the Apex. That makes a lot of sense. I will get to the bottom of this."
