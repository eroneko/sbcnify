    "Working on an airship is one step closer to my dream. I wanna be part of a starship crew - of course, who doesn't - but these airships are the next best thing. Keeping everything top notch, in working order, this is my calling. It's hard work, but no harder than living in the thrall of Kluex. Here, I'm liberated.",

    "I often think back to my days training as an Ascendant. At night I dream of the Celestial Tower, of those steps leading up to the heavens, and the descent that would have awaited me at the top. All told, I prefer a deck beneath my feet."
