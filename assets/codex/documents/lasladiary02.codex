    "Fear.
I have received word from the home village. My parents - devout Flightless - retain elicit contact with me. It's a risk, and I appreciate it. My brother has been training as an Ascendant for many years. He is the fastest, the strongest, the best in his unit. Now the time has come that we all feared.",

    "My dear brother Shir'en has been selected to make the journey up the Celestial Stairway, to dive from the tower. Fly or Die, the Grounded call it. If my brother soars, he will take his place as a Sunborn, a god. But if he falls... 
Kluex save him. For the first time in years, I pray that you are real."
