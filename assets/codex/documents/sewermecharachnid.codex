    "by Greenfinger of the Floran
Unable to deal with the Growfly, and unwilling to accept my offer of a dozen Floran Greenguard being dispatched into the sewer, the Glitch Outcasts created a giant mechanical spider - part creature, part robot, it stalks the sewers looking for the Growfly.",

    "However, the Glitch did not consider that their creation was evenly matched with its quarry, and now the two are locked in an everlasting battle, neither gaining the upper hand for long. However, the Mecharachnid has managed to kill plenty of other things, including its original creators, so there's that."
