    "by Greenfinger of the Floran
And so it transpires, within the sewers, that there is a creature formed entirely of waste. Bodily waste. This distasteful beast is less dangerous than it is disgusting, and travellers are advised not to get too close.",

    "The beast seemingly can't be killed, simply reforming eventually after destruction. My Glitch contacts shudder as they tell me of this creature, and I do not blame them. I'm not sure I'd even task a Floran with dealing with this mess."
