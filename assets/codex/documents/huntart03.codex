    "by Floran Huntmaster Sunflower Tzu
Why only destroy? Why exist just to hunt? A Hylotl said this to Sunflower Tzu once. I stabbed it, then thought on what it said. The answer is simple. Because hunting is awesome. Hunt. Track. Stab. Other species missing out.",

    "Floran superiority asserted through stabbing and to a lesser extent, singing around campfires. Hunting is in our sap, it is who we are. Do not fight the hunt, or the hunt will fight you. With stabbing."
