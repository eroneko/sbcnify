    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
Trees! They live in trees. These living, savage plants live in huge tree houses built with care and attention. It's a far cry from our wonderful ocean paradise, of course, but one has to admire the tenacity with which this species attempts to carve out a niche to call their own.",

    "The craftsmanship is much as you'd expect from the Florans - crude to say the least - but there's a certain undeniable charm. I've had plenty of time to study this as I've been hiding in one of their tree houses for three days now, waiting for my chance to slip away unnoticed. Oh, what fun adventuring is!"
