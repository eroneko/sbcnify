    "How am I meant to further the Apex species when our labs get attacked? And by a member of the Ring of Thorns, no less. That Thornwing will get an earful next time we have cocktails.",

    "I sent my elite Miniknog guards to clean up the mess. Doctor Lax's body was gone. What kind of lunatic kidnaps a body! Oh well. Probably eaten by Florans. Managed to recover some of the notes and that, so I've hired another doctor to carry on with the research.",

    "On the plus side, my Miniknog spies were able to track down that annoying blogger who kept posting NDA-protected information. He's hiding out in a human prison, of all places. Might place a call to Thornwing to deal with him, I guess."
