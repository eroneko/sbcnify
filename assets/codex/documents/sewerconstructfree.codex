    "From the journal of Platinum Ace, Outcast leader
It has been many years since I separated myself from the Glitch hivemind, and I am still amazed by how liberated, how free we are. They strut up their in their castles, swinging their maces and polishing their silverware.",

    "Meanwhile, we reach for the stars, we build our own constructs and advance the species. Who, truly, are the outcasts now? We have surpassed our kin in so many ways. And yet, still we are exiled, steel pariahs crawling through sewer and swamp just for the chance to truly live."
