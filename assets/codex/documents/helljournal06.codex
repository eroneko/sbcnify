    "I dream of oaken soldiers once more. Who is this army that sprawls before me? I feel a stiffening in my limbs as I wake. I think The Dust is getting to me. I require Drysap treatment once a week now, and even then it does little to ease my discomfort.",

    "Today I killed a prisoner. I pushed him down the stairs on the way to dinner. The other guards cheered and hooted, but I felt no such pleasure. The thrill of the hunt is gone from me. I should set a torch to them and see how well they hunt then."
