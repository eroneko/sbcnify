    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
It is with pride that I look upon the Avian holy texts, after exploring other species' religions. Many of their holy books are dubious, their origins undocumented, their words 'channelled'. Ours are penned by Kluex himself, the handwriting able to be matched to historical documents written by the mortal before he became a god.",

    "This proof, I feel, is intrinsically linked to the strength of Avian faith. We do not have to blindly believe in our God, because we know he exists. Some of our number, the Stargazers, even visit him in person. This makes it all the more inexplicable that there are some amongst the Grounded who deny Kluex's existence altogether."
