    "Taken from The Steel Casebook

Deckard: Confrontational. A Hylotl lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping. Why is that?",

    "Leeron: Scientific. I am assessing the area for potential danger. The Hylotl could be part of a trap. I am conducting scans and sending reports. Only when my assessment is complete will I help the Hylotl. I would also consider that the Hylotl may be engaging in performance art.",

    "Deckard: Approving. Good answer."
