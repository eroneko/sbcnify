    "by Rochard Hawkwings
While the Flightless blindly follow the teachings of the Clipped Council, those of us who are enlightened - grounded, if you will - question it. Many of us, in fact, are of the opinion that Kluex does not even exist.",

    "What evidence is there? What SCIENTIFIC evidence? Proof. That's what the universe revolves around. There is little proof that Kluex exists, other than people who claim to have seen him. There's also his space station, of course, floating just outside of orbit.",

    "A lonely, desolate place. Fit for a god? I do not believe so. If you ask me, that space station is a spy satellite. Watching us. Recording our personal data. Sending reports to the Council about what we do, think, eat, drink. They're watching us all."
