    "I heard noises today, deep within the tomb. I followed the sounds through darkened corridors, my torch flickering shadows on the wall, but I could not trace the source. I wondered, for a while, if another Miniknog agent had infiltrated my sanctuary. But the noise was different; not something trying to get in, but something trying to get out.",

    "I began to pull the lids off the sarcophagi, disturbing the bodies within, searching for one who may have been buried alive. Of course, the crumbling bones were unmoving. Yet still the sound persisted. A scraping, scrabbling sound. I will investigate further."
