    "The sounds of fighting had died down. I saw the creature, the assassin, stalking out of the building, seemingly content with its work. I waited, then cautiously made my way out, towards the test chamber, the door ajar.",

    "I peered inside, unsure of what I'd find. There, Doctor Lax lay slumped inside a large capsule, a syringe stuck in her neck, pumping what appeared to be a combination of Formula F and H into her veins. She was dead, of course.",

    "Whatever had been inside the test chamber originally was long gone. But Doctor Lax's notes remained. This... this changes everything. What we've been doing, what we've been working towards, it's an abomination. How could Big Ape condone this?",

    "My next blog post will blow this whole thing wide open. I'm going into hiding. I need to make sure I'm safe, and then I'm blowing the whistle on all of this. The Miniknog - Big Ape himself - must be stopped."
