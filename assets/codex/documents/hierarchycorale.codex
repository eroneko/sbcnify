    "by Hiraki Corale

The Glitch - at least those who remain true to their roots - are unusual in that they have no hierarchy system. Their roles are interchangeable; a Glitch who may be a baker one day will be a stonemason the next. What is curious is the lack of vocal organisation.",

    "In my time here, I've never heard the Glitch planning these roles, they simply happen, working like clockwork. Despite the species' somewhat backwards technological state, they're remarkably efficient.",

    "They operate as a hivemind, but what's strange about that is the Glitch have developed self-awareness, yet these robots appear to CHOOSE this way of life, vehemently rejecting those - the Outcasts - who begin to think for themselves. Exciting!"
