    "We came into the lab today to find all of the Formula H test subjects dead. Their bodies had just shut down. Doctor Lax treated it as if it was expected. Maybe it was. She's acting strange lately. I don't like it.",

    "Lax has her own experimental chamber, and there's definitely something in there. I hear noises. I'm often the last one in the lab, and I won't lie, it creeps me out. I hear growling, and banging on the doors, and sometimes even low sobbing.",

    "One day, I'm going to be brave enough to take a look. Just a quick peek. I've seen the access code Lax enters. I could get in. I just... I'm nervous. The test chamber is marked with so many 'danger' signs that I feel hesitant."
