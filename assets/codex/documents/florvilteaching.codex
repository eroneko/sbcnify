    "A number of Glitch have appeared in Floran villages, with the intention of educating our people. It's a noble pursuit - I've always stated that the ability to read and write is something the Floran should aspire to, but it's hard to persuade the general populace.",

    "The Glitch are in a good position to do this, as their metal exteriors largely protect them from Floran blades. However, we are at a stage where we now have Florans running around writing words on anything and everything, with typical Floran over-enthusiasm. It is, however, an improvement over the time they attempted to learn how to paint."
