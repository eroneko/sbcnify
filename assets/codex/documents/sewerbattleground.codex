    "From the journal of Platinum Ace, Outcast leader
I feel it in my metal - one day, maybe not today, or tomorrow, but soon, the Outcasts will rise up. We will free the hivemind from their oppression, we will liberate our people. We will introduce the Glitch to choice, to technological advancement, to free thought. We will shatter the hivemind, and the Outcasts will be outcast no more."
