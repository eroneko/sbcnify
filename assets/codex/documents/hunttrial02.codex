    "The second trial began in a temple. The young Floran was faced with an impossible choice; brave an ocean of flame which would scorch even the woodiest of elders, or walk through a pitch-black tunnel. The young Floran smiled. Wrapping her spear in the pelt of the monkey she'd killed earlier, she plunged it into the fire, creating a makeshift torch.",

    "This allowed her to see clearly in the dark passageway, which turned out to be filled with spikes and blades and at least two semi-working arrow traps. After ducking, rolling and weaving her way through, the young Floran emerged victorious on the other side, and stabbed a nearby bat/octopus hybrid to celebrate. Feeling confident, she pressed on."
