    "Our Clipped Council liaison came by today, and a well-placed bribe ensured I won't have to be sharing a room with the others. No more worrying about late-night visits. Next, I sent word to my man outside the village; he is to deliver a message of great importance.",

    "Then, our mental training began. I outclassed the others with ease, as I knew I would. My mind is the sharpest it has ever been. I could see them staring at me, angrily, just willing me to succeed, planning what they'd do to me when I did. They're going to have a rude awakening."
