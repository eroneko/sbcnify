    "WARNING: Outcasts operate in this area

A number of Outcasts have been spotted in this area, sharing ideas and philosophies with all who will listen. 

DO NOT LISTEN!",

    "Individual behaviour will not be tolerated, and will upset the Glitch way of life. Do not accept it. Should you encounter an Outcast behaving badly, ensure you contact the relevant authorities, or failing that, hit them repeatedly with a large hammer until they go away."
