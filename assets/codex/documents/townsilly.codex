    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer
These Miniknog sure do treat the other Apex badly! So sad! They're always barking out orders or firing rounds into the sky. It's very tedious and stressful. Really, you can't blame me for ditching my escort, can you?",

    "I happened to find myself in what I think must be a Resistance Headquarters. So rebellious! I recognised some of the faces from wanted posters. The Apex stared at me as if I was some sort of intruder or something. One of them was shivering and looked sick, so I loaned her my Big Ape-branded jacket. So kind!"
