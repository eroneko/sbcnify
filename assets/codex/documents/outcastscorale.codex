The Glitch do not typically seek out and destroy any Outcasts, they simply banish them. However, some Glitch communities have developed a repurposing process, a few mechanical tweaks that reformats a Glitch mind and strengthens the bond to the hivemind.",

    "As such, many Outcasts seek to flee the cities, reaching out for help from the Outcast sleeper agents who operate within the walls. Thrilling! It's like being in a spy novel."
