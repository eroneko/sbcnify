    "by Floran Huntmaster Sunflower Tzu
Sunflower Tzu has observed that many species have 'rules of war'. Florans do not observe such ridiculous practises. Why face your armed enemy on the battlefield when you can stab them in their sleep? Why see the whites of their eyes when you can trick them into falling on spikes? To fail is to bring dishonour upon your cocoon-kin. There is no such thing as cheating, only failing."
