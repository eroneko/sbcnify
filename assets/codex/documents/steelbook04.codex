    "by Hewlett Deckard
Glitch bounty hunter

Just another tragic story, another Outcast looking to escape being repurposed. She'd heard about me, heard who I was. Sometimes, this double life gets on top of me, but other times, like last night, when I save a life, it's all worth it.",

    "She'd killed our Glitch, of course. He'd been cleaning her windows and observed her engaging in Outcast behaviour. She killed him and moved his body to another location, the place he was always seen.",

    "I made sure she left the city safely, and promised to cover up her crime. It's an easy job. I'll do what I always do, and close the case by saying a Floran did it. Besides, the victim should be out of the repair bay in a couple more days. No harm done."
