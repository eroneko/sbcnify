    "From the journal of Platinum Ace, Outcast leader
We caught a hivemind Glitch attempting to infiltrate our ranks today. Our agents are slipping. We argued over what to do with this Glitch for a while, thankfully having caught her before she entered the tunnels, and eventually a severing was decided upon.",

    "Using technology we have been developing, we are now able to sever ties from the hivemind even if the Glitch in question is not compliant, and so we did here. She will be watched, this new addition, but for now she seems liberated and grateful. Interesting."
