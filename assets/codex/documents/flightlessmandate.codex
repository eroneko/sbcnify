    "We walk the earth, our wings trailing dust, no longer do we fly. We do this out of love and devotion. Kluex guides us, Kluex begs us. We ask not for answers; the wisdom of the Sunborn is absolute. And yet, Kluex grants us answers. As our population grew, so did our impact on the skies.",

    "Too close we flew to the sun, too close to our gods. They grew weak, tired, from watching over us. They could no longer protect us. And so we make this sacrifice; our wings stay clipped, in the knowledge that one day our species will strengthen, and Kluex will allow us to fly once more."
