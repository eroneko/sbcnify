    "Almighty Kluex
Last of the Sunborn
Soar above us
Watch over us
Bless us with your glory.",

    "We the flightless
Turn our heads heavenwards
To you, oh Kluex
Last of the Sunborn
Our star in the sky.",

    "Bless the Ascendants
Who peck at the earth
Waiting for your call
May they one day soar
Into Kluex's loving embrace."
