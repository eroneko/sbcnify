    "Upon first contact with the Floran Brood in [Redacted], the USCM far underestimated the level of aggression, cunning and savagery the Floran race would eventually become known for.",

    "During one of many border skirmishes with the expansionist Florans, Commander [Redacted] of the Sabre-class Battlecruiser USS [Redacted] attempted to relieve embattled USCM troops by covering advancing Floran forces with thousands of gallons of Solution 2,4-D, otherwise known as herbicide.",

    "The effect however, did not perform as expected, with the solution having roughly the same poisonous qualities as alcohol does to a human. Nevertheless, the move \"distracted\" the Florans enough for the Marines to launch a counterattack and overwhelm them, securing the planetside colony long enough to complete its emergency evacuation.",

    "The tactic has not seen use since, but lives on in history as the [Redacted] Manoeuvre."
