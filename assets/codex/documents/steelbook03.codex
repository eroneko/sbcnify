Glitch bounty hunter

Leeron is not the Glitch I'm looking for. I conducted numerous interviews with her, and she is not self-aware. Her windows, she claims, just require washing very frequently due to being downwind from a logging mill. I have confirmed this.",

    "However, as I returned from the logging mill, brooding and moody, I was pulled into a dark alley by an unknown assailant. I knew the broad was trouble as soon as I laid eyes on her. She had that look, that self-aware stance, but also one of desperation. 

'I need your help,' she said, as my fingers twitched over my mace."
