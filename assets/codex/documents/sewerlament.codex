    "The paper is stained brown.
These dank tunnels hide my grim visage; I am grateful for the respite it has provided over the years, but still, I long to be out in the sunlight, to feel the breeze upon my face, to greet my family once more. Memories, melting away, dripping from my mind like tears from my eyes as I stalk these corridors simply hoping, praying, that one day things will be different."
