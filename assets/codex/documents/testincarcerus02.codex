    "The Miniknog are beginning to gain control of the experiment. Despite having taken on the role of prisoners, the dynamic is very clear. They do what they want, and in some cases even tell the citizens - the guards - what to do. It is very interesting to observe.",

    "Earlier, I visited the common room to find the Miniknog playing ball games, and the citizens locked in the cells. The self-styled leader of the Miniknog prisoners, Hairbiter McVey, informed me that they'd requested some 'chill-out time'.",
