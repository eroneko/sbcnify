The Floran diplomats stood talking amicably as the Hylotl representative approached. \"Filth!\" the Hylotl cried. \"Have you no shame, standing here with your leaves and flowers, defying the very laws of nature?\"

    "\"Perhaps we should stab him,\" suggested Diplomat Barkskinner. 
\"I concur,\" replied Diplomat Vinestrangler.
