    "It is done. Larbeaks is no more. Nobody suspects a thing. And yet I am shaken, concerned. You see, the Helion visited me after the kill. This is unheard of. Almost never do the Helion reveal themselves to their clients. And yet, I woke up in the night to feel a hand on my shoulder.",

    "The Helion was not what I expected. He was soft-spoken, calm. His name is Hish'eth and he said I knew my mother. That he'd been there when she died. I asked him if that meant what I thought it meant. He shook his head, and I thought I could detect a sadness in his eyes.",

    "He asked about the Ascension. I explained it all to him, about my journey to become a Sunborn. The Helion laughed and accused me of hubris. 'Why risk your life to achieve godhood when you can become a god of your own making?' he asked. I thought about the Celestial Tower, about the fall, about the numerous Avians who did not fly."
