    "My attempts at blackmail have backfired. I'm here, trapped on the smuggler's ship, in the cargo hold. Kluex knows where they're taking me. Maybe they'll hand me over to this Floran I keep hearing about. There are rumblings of live experiments.",

    "I have no choice but to escape. I'll have to get creative. All I have is a bunch of smuggled power crystals, my soldering iron, and my robot, which for some reason the smugglers seem to have retrieved and attempted to fix. Naturally, they've broken it even more.",

    "I think I can salvage it, though. Perhaps in a different manner. I have an idea. I need a means of escaping myself, not simply a way of taking down the smugglers. Inspiration is building up inside me."
