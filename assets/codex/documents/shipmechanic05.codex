    "I had to destroy my robot today. Some meddling Hylotl found her way to my workshop, and for some reason this turned my companion hostile. It proceeded to patrol around the ship, menacing Avians, until I was able to shut it down a few hours later. After retrieving the power crystal, I threw my robot overboard.",

    "I plan to make a larger, more powerful robot, but it's going to require more power crystals. Perhaps with the right amount, I can give it enough intelligence to stop it attacking people on sight. Luckily the smuggler ship will be docking with us again later this evening, and I can make another request."
