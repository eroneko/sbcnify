    "From the Heavens, silence. The Sunborn spoke no more. Where had they gone? Had their light simply extinguished? Had they fallen from the sky, become grounded? One Avian, a hero, Kluex of the Goldentips, sought answers. He trained, and trained, until eventually he was able to fly high enough to reach the thrones of the Sunborn, beyond our skies, in the far reaches of space.",

    "And there, in the Sanctuary of the Sunborn, Kluex was blessed with the power of our rulers; they live vicariously through him, his word is the law. Praise Kluex, the glorious Sunborn who will redeem us all."
