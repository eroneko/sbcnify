    "Big Ape protect me. I never thought I'd say that. Never thought I'd miss the Miniknog. Never thought I'd want to go home. These creatures, they're... ruthless, evil killing machines. It's like the forest has come to life around me.",

    "All they do is jeer and prance and yell 'stab' over and over. They're hunting me. 'Big Ape is watching'? Well why aren't you watching me now? Save me from these living nightmares. They will haunt me for the rest of my days. They would look rather nice in flowerpots on my windowsill, though. Hmm."
