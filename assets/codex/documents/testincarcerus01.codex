    "Day One. The inmates are doing well. There had been some in-fighting, but this was quickly tempered with some short blasts of cold water. Observing the chatter, it is surprisingly how quickly the Miniknog soldiers are adapting to life behind bars.",

    "The Apex citizens are not adopting their guard roles quite so easily. They are hesitant, unsure of themselves, and unwilling to assert their authority over the prisoners. This is interesting, as my original hypothesis predicted that the citizens would quickly turn on the Miniknog.",

    "Perhaps current Miniknog methods are fully effective in conditioning the citizens to obey. Perhaps Big Ape is wrong to be concerned. But still, this is only day one of the experiment, and a lot could change."
