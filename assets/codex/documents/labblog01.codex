    "Yesterday I was prodding and poking at tiny monster corpses, working out how they tick. Today, I'm assistant to the most brilliant Apex mind in history (aside from Big Ape, of course), working on a top secret, important project.",

    "It's funny how your life can change! I never thought my talent would be noticed, and yet here I am. Doctor Lax is a stern, serious woman. She's very focused on work. This suits me fine. Already, the lab workers who slack off have been let go."
