    "As one of the few Glitch to achieve self awareness you were forced to flee your home with little preparation. Your ship has run out of fuel in orbit of an unknown planet. Being an outcast in unsympathetic territory is hard. Being an outcast stuck in space is even harder, you find.",

    "But with self awareness comes self preservation. No longer tied to the hivemind, you have the capability to think indepedently, and get yourself out of this mess. At least, in theory. It's time to find out just how useful sentient thought can be."
