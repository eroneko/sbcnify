    "The Formula F test subjects are producing great results. At least, that's what I'm told. I like to think I have a great understanding of my work, but even then, I can't fathom exactly what's going on here. It doesn't help that half the results are redacted.",

    "I feel like my role here is to press buttons and flip switches, and nothing more. Doctor Lax, when she bothers to emerge from her test chamber at all, simply snatches the results from my hand and stalks off. It's all very disconcerting.",

    "Lax has been especially jumpy lately, too. She's surrounding herself with Miniknog guards, even having them search us each day as we enter the lab. It's no longer an enjoyable working environment. Still, at least we have Big Ape's visit to look forward to."
