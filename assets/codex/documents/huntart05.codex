    "by Floran Huntmaster Sunflower Tzu
Traditionally, Sunflower Tzu recommend Floran use stabbing weapons, but only because they can stab. Anything can be used as a weapon. Bones, branches, pennies in a sock, all traditional, primal weaponry.",

    "And when your weapons break, do not be afraid to use the strength Nature gave you. Once, Sunflower Tzu punched a bear's head clean off. You too can achieve this if you try."
