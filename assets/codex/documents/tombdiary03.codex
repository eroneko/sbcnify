    "I caught an intruder today. A young Apex, dressed in black, creeping his way through the tunnels and corridors until I put a stop to that. I knocked the apeman unconscious and searched him. His clothing bore the insignia of the Miniknog.",

    "What could the Miniknog be after in an Avian tomb? Talk says that Big Ape is the richest being in the universe, so what could they possibly want to steal? I attempted to question the Apex, but before I could react he ate a poisoned banana he'd stowed in his sleeve, and was lost to me. I stored his body in a sarcophagus. I hope nobody notices."
