    "by Rochard Hawkwings
I received a reply from Apex leader Big Ape, which I shall reprint in the pages of this book:",

    "'Sup,
Big Ape, here. Kluex, you say? A god? An Avian god? Big Ape is not familiar with this individual. But Big Ape will be happy to challenge your god Kluex to a no-holds-barred cage match, to prove ape superiority once and for all. Any time, any place, anything goes. The Miniknog are always ready.
Love,
Glorious Leader Big Ape'",


    "It remains to be seen whether Kluex will accept this offer."
