    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
I boarded another airship village today, when it had stopped to dock. Climbed my way up the anchor and squirreled myself into a cabin before anyone could complain. Everything was going well; the captain, a jolly fellow called Wrenolds, allowed me to teach him how to play Lilyflip. We were half way through a game when it happened. I was winning.",

    "The door to the cargo hold splintered open, and a large, metallic Avian came striding out. Swiftly he dispatched a number of the ship's crew, punching and smashing his way around. I cowered in fear, hiding behind the captain, who let off some shots from his rifle.",

    "The bullets simply bounced off the iron Avian, who laughed, smashed the ship's mast, then leaped into the air. A glowing circle on his chest began to pulsate, then thrusters in the man's feet kicked in, and the Avian took off, soaring into the skies like a rocket ship. What a sight!",

    "I was unaware the Avians had developed armour that allowed them to fly again. I commented on this to Wrenolds, and he told me it was unheard of. He muttered something about power crystals, and then I heard him mention my dear friend Greenfinger, who they were apparently going to see. What luck! I informed him he could drop me off there."
