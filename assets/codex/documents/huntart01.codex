    "by Floran Huntmaster Sunflower Tzu
Some believe that the only worthy prey is that which is larger, stronger, faster than you. Sunflower Tzu say; nonsense. Kill's a kill. If it moves, stab it. If it fights back, stab it a lot.",

    "If it charges you off a cliff, pins you to a tree and bites you repeatedly, stab stab stab until your hunting crew arrive. Happened to me once. Monstrous creature. First 'human' I ever killed. Good hunt. Good times."
