    "A Prayer to Kluex
by Anonymous

Dear Kluex, save us from the storm. 
Our wings are gone, our feathers torn. 
We walk the earth, but long to soar,
We cannot take off any more.",

    "Oh Kluex, with your glorious might,
Come bless us now and give us flight. 
We serve you as you make your plans,
Oh, let us fly to promised lands."
