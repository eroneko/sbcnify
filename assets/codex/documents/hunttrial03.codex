    "The young Floran emerged into a clearing and reeled back in horror. A grey festering blob of infinite malevolence writhed before her. 'How will I defeat this?' she asked herself as she fell to her knees, calling out to the sky for answers. Since she'd fallen awkwardly, she felt the hilt of her knife digging into her hip, and the answer became clear.",

The young Floran left, buzzing from the hunt, and grateful that she'd managed to catch the blob before it had noticed her."
