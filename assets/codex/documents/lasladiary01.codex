    "Conflicted.
I left my home; I came here, to this Grounded commune, because of love. I have - had - love for Kluex, there's no denying that. But the love I hold for my wife is immeasurable. I love her more than our God. She is a dedicated Grounded, denying Kluex's very existence entirely.",

    "I hide my belief from her, of course. I nod along when she preaches about our false messiah, I attend all the meetings, I join her in burning the idols. And yet... somewhere, at the back of my mind, I still feel Kluex's presence, his guiding light. But it's fading, more every day. I wonder if I'll notice when it's gone."
