    "by Greenfinger of the Floran
My Glitch contacts tell me of a creature lurking in the sewers. It is not found elsewhere, and as such poses an interesting question: How can we get hold of one so the Floran can fight it? It is a giant fly, grown to epic proportions, and extremely aggressive in nature.",

    "The Glitch tell me that it was created when a fly and a slightly bigger fly got into a random teleportation accident, although this does not account for its huge size. Perhaps there is something in the water down there."
