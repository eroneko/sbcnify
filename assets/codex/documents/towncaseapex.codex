    "by Hewlett Deckard, Glitch bounty hunter
Arriving at an Apex settlement always fills me with sadness. The Apex plight is not unlike the Glitch's, but a thousand times worse. Here, Big Ape and his awful Miniknog have broken the population, reducing them to mindless slaves.",

    "Put a foot wrong, and the Miniknog are on you. Do nothing wrong, and chances are they will be anyway. I hear talk of mysterious labs on remote planets, of horrific experiments and terrifying beasts."
