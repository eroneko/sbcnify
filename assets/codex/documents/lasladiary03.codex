    "Tragedy.
My brother. My dear, dear brother. We could not stop him. He climbed the Celestial Stairway and leaped. He spread his wings, but did not fly. He fell, fell, fell like so many Flightless, headlong towards the ground. He would not become a god this day. Kluex, you have failed me. You have failed us all.",

    "If it wasn't for the pile of hay positioned by chance below the tower, my brother would be dead. But a concussion is pretty bad news, too. Curse you, Kluex. I defy you. I accept the Grounded ways. Tonight, I begin reading my wife's copy of The Kluex Delusion."
