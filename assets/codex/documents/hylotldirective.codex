    "Dearest Hylotl missionary,
You have gone out into the great wide world to spread the glory of our species, and to help those less fortunate than ourselves. For this, we thank you.",

    "May the Hylotl spread peace throughout the universe. Be discerning. Be polite. And remember Directive 0451. If you do not know what Directive 0451 is, then do not worry about it. Or ask about it. Just do your job, okay?"
