    "Hish'eth was right. Why settle for joining Kluex, IF I survive? Once I leap off the tower, I have no way to give myself an advantage. It all rests in the hands of Kluex. I don't like those odds. I control my own destiny.",

    "Hish'eth gave me a datapad with co-ordinates on it. I believe it to be a sector somewhere in Hylotl space. 'Go here,' he said. 'Go here and follow your true destiny' - and then he was gone.",

    "Finding a spaceship won't be hard. Getting off-planet won't be hard. I have the finances, and I have the means. Something in my heart is telling me that THIS is my destiny; not to become some old god, rotting on a Sunborn throne beside Kluex, but to carve my own throne in my image.",

    "I will become an unstoppable force. And the universe shall know the name Thornwing."
