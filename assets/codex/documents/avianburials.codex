    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
There are many forms of Avian burial, and the method often comes from the last will and testament of the deceased. Some Avians choose to float off attached to large balloons, while others favour cremation. Many simply opt for burial, but it is only the most important Avians who end up interred in tombs.",

    "Our tombs are vast and many, and the Sunborn through the ages are said to rest in many of them. Of course, the locations of the Sunborn's corpses have never been disclosed due to potential looters, but any tomb one steps in could hold the body of a god. ",

    "It is strange to think that our deities lie entombed amongst mortals. Strange to think of our gods dying, and yet all that remains is Kluex. May he live forever."
