    "by Floran Huntmaster Sunflower Tzu
During long travels in the Greater Wilderness, Sunflower Tzu discover abandoned Human supply house. Oddly, supplies included mysterious Moving Picture Machine and rare functioning Shiny Circle needed to make it work.",

    "This shiny circle had nothing of note, showing a group of Human Warriors at their prime navigating through a place very similar to the Great Flora, until one of them says, \"If bleeds, we can kill it.\" Such perspective had not crossed the mind of Sunflower Tzu, and prompted many day cycles of contemplation."
