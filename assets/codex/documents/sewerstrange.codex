    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
I found myself face to face with a giant flying creature, and naturally I ran as fast as my adventurous legs would carry me. I could feel the beast gaining on me, the air from its wings tickling the back of my neck, when suddenly a hand reached out from the shadows and grabbed me, pulling me to safety.",

    "I found myself in a small room, clearly living quarters. A smell hung in the air, unpleasant and strange. I gazed upon my saviour and my jaw dropped."
