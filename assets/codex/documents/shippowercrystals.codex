    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
One of our species' most proud achievements, the Power Crystals we harness can be used in all manner of ways, from machinery to lighting to cooking. These crystals are in high demand across the universe, of course, but the Avians keep them close to their chest.",

    "It is a worry, albeit an unavoidable one, that the Grounded have such ready access to the crystals. What worries me even more is that, despite using these miraculous minerals, they still deny the power of Kluex. Who else could create such wonders, if not a god?"
