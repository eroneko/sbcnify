    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer
Having found myself accidentally enrolled as an Avian Ascendant, I figured I might as well make the most of it and go with the flow. If it comes to it, and I'm chosen to leap off the tower, I have this jetpack I borrowed from the Miniknog. So exciting!",

    "Imagine that; Hiraki Corale, Avian god. The first Hylotl Avian god in history, I'd wager! In the meantime, however, I accidentally started rummaging through one of my fellow student's belongings, and what should I find? Greenfinger's delightful Strengthsap elixir!",

    "Now, I like nothing more than tasting Greenfinger's concoctions, but the Strengthsap has always been one of my favourites. I couldn't resist taking a sip, and ended up drinking the whole lot. So naughty! I hope the Avian who I borrowed it from doesn't mind!"
