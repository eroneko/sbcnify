    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer
I find myself in a Miniknog-controlled Apex town. But oh, control is such an ugly word, isn't it? The Apex here are all so polite, and friendly. They bow and grovel as I pass, my Miniknog entourage only occasionally having to knock them back!",

    "It's all very exciting. An audience with Big Ape! Greenfinger told me he's heard about my exploits, and would like to pick my brain. I mean gosh, I've heard rumours about Big Ape picking peoples' brains, but I don't think it means that this time."
