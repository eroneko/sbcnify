    "by notable Avian critic Roger Seabird
Billed as 'the great Floran novel' by its Glitch publishers, Floran Peace had a lot to live up to. It does, of course, fail on all accounts. The savage plant-species may be skilled hunters, but this skill does not translate to the page. The novel is a mess of plot ideas that go nowhere, with everything being resolved via stabbing.",

    "Character development is nonexistent, and it's impossible to warm to any of the protagonists given their propensity for murder. The middle section, particularly puzzling, is simply a fifty thousand word diatribe against the Hylotl. Despite the old adage, it seems that for the author Florstab, the sword is in fact mightier than the pen."
