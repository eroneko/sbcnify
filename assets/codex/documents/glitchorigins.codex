Critical. the Glitch were left to expand and evolve, eventually deconstructing themselves to discover that they were artificial.",

    "Glitch understanding of the world led to the realization that an artificial species must have a creator. Sceptical. This discovery triggered self-awareness in the Glitch. Some accepted their role in the universe, others began to question it.",

    "Melancholy. This caused much civil turmoil, which lasted hundreds of years. As such, the Glitch failed to evolve beyond basic construction abilities. Regret. The Glitch experiment was abandoned and the species was left to fend for itself."
