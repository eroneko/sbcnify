    "Proud. My young charge, this eager Floran youth, has expressed much delight in the idea of becoming a famous writer. Encouraged. I am teaching him how to construct sentences, and he is making fast progress.",

    "Pleased. I think perhaps this could be the first educated Floran the universe has ever seen. Daydreaming. Imagine it, a Floran, writing the great universal novel. Reluctant. But there is much work to be done. Disappointed. I still need to teach him that 'stab' does not stand in for just any word."
