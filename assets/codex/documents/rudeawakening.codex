    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
I awoke to find myself surrounded by hooded figures, chanting and squawking. One of them, who appeared to be the figurehead, held a large knife above me. At first I was disoriented, and thought I was back with the Florans. But no. It seems I'd accidentally presented myself for sacrifice. So silly!",

    "Of course, I wasn't up for this! Quick as a flash, I kicked the head priest in the face and made my escape, charging through the temple like a Hylotl possessed. There were a few casualties along the way, of course - some sacred urns, a statue or two, an Avian monk - but I escaped intact, and carried on my way."
